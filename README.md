# Light Cipher Attacks Paper

This paper analyzes the state of the art of methods for breaking two specific light ciphers: **Simon** and **Speck**.

Initially, classical methods are examined, primarily based on Key Exhaustive Search and the results are expressed in terms of rounds, time complexity and data complexity. Later, attention is given to quantum methods, explaining in detail how they work based on Grover's algorithm.
